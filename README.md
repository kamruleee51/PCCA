## 📌 Overview

**PROMISE-Net (PROmpt Modulated Integration for SEgmentation)** is a **prompt-aware medical image segmentation framework** that introduces a novel attention mechanism called **Prompt-Conditioned Channel Attention (PCCA)**.  

The core idea is to **deeply integrate user-provided spatial prompts (e.g., bounding boxes)** into **every stage of an encoder–decoder network**, enabling **hierarchical, prompt-driven feature modulation** instead of shallow or late-stage prompt fusion.

This repository contains the **official implementation** of the models proposed in the paper:

## 🚀 Key Contributions

### 🔹 Prompt-Conditioned Channel Attention (PCCA)
- A **lightweight, channel-wise attention module**
- Conditions feature excitation on **both image features and prompt embeddings**
- Enables **prompt-aware gating** across the entire network hierarchy

### 🔹 Hierarchical Prompt Integration
- Prompts influence:
  - Early **low-level texture features**
  - Mid-level **structural representations**
  - High-level **semantic abstractions**
- Prevents loss of prompt information in deep networks

### 🔹 Cross-Architectural Generality
- Works seamlessly with:
  - **CNN-based backbones** → **PROMISE-CNN**
  - **Transformer-based backbones** → **PROMISE-Txformer**

### 🔹 Strong Generalization
- Validated across:
  - Multiple **anatomical structures**
  - Diverse **imaging modalities**
  - Binary **and** multi-class segmentation tasks

📌 **PCCA is inserted at *every encoder and decoder stage***, allowing prompts to continuously guide feature learning.

## 🏗️ Model Variants

### 🔵 PROMISE-CNN
- Based on **U-Net**
- Strong at capturing **local textures and boundaries**
- Lightweight and efficient

### 🟣 PROMISE-Txformer
- Based on **UNETR**
- Leverages **global self-attention**
- Better long-range dependency modeling

Both variants use **the same PCCA module**, demonstrating architectural flexibility.
